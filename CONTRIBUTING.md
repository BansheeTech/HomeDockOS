## Why HomeDock OS is not accepting contributions (yet)

HomeDock OS is currently source-visible under the **PolyForm Strict License 1.0.0**, which is not a strictly open source license as defined by the OSI. This is an intentional and temporary decision to protect the long-term sustainability of the project.

We’re a self-funded team, and actually HomeDock OS is a **SaaS-only platform**, we don’t sell hardware. That means the software itself _is_ our product. Releasing it under a permissive license too early would open the door to being cloned or exploited by better-funded competitors before we’re ready to compete on equal terms.

We **believe deeply in the open source model** and the value of community collaboration. But we also believe that **true collaboration must be reciprocal**. Since we can’t yet offer the freedoms of open source (like the right to fork or commercial re-use), we don’t accept pull requests or external code contributions.

We don’t want people working for free on software they can’t fully use or redistribute, that’s not ethical, and it’s not how we understand open collaboration.

That said, we **do welcome feedback, suggestions, bug reports and technical discussion**. Just not code contributions, at least not yet.

This is not a philosophy of control, but a **protection phase**. Companies like Sentry and Plausible adopted similar approaches early on, before transitioning to OSI-approved licenses once they became sustainable. That’s our plan too, when HomeDock OS is financially stable, we intend to move to a license like **AGPLv3**, enabling true open collaboration without risking the future of the project.

For now, we’re focused on building a strong foundation, and opening up **when we’re ready**, not when it’s already too late. We’d rather be cautious and open up when sustainable, than follow the trend of “open first, close later” which only erodes trust, as we’ve seen with other platforms in this space.

Thanks for understanding and for supporting a future open HomeDock OS.
